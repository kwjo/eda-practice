# Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
## What is EDA?
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analysing and understanding a dataset before applying any formal modeling or statistical techniques. It helps uncover underlying structures, spot anomalies, test assumptions, and generate insights.
## Why is EDA important?
- Understanding of the dataset
- Detecting patterns, trends, and relationships
- Identifying missing or inconsistent data
- Guiding data cleaning and transformation
- Forming hypotheses for further analysis
- Improving the performance and reliability of predictive models
## How to EDA? (in a nutshell)
1. What is the question of interest? (objective)
2. Data initial inspection
3. Data cleaning and wrangling
4. Descriptive statistics
5. Univariate and bivariate/multivariate analysis
6. Data visualisations
